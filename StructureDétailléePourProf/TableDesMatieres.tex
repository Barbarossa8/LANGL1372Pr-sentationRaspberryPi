\section{Summary}

\subsection{The Raspberry Pi Foundation}

\paragraph{}The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a charity founded in 2009 to promote the study of basic computer science in schools, and is responsible for developing a single-board computer called the Raspberry Pi, UK's best-selling PC of all time.

\paragraph{}The foundation is supported by the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory and Broadcom. It's aim is to « promote the study of computer science and related topics, especially at school level, and to put the fun back into learning computing ».

\subsection{The Raspberry Pi}

\paragraph{}The Raspberry Pi is a series of credit card-sized single-board computers developed in England, United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation with the intent to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and developing countries.

\paragraph{}Several generations of Raspberry Pi's have been released. The first (Pi 1) was released in February 2012 in basic model A and a higher specification model B. A+ and B+ models were released a year later. Raspberry Pi 2 model B was released in February 2015 and Raspberry Pi 3 model B in February 2016. These boards are priced between 20\$ and 35\$. A cut down compute model was released in April 2014 and a Pi Zero with smaller footprint and limited IO (Input/Output) capabilities released in November 2015 for 5\$ !!!

\section{Personnal opinion}

\paragraph{Antonio}

\paragraph{}I think that the Raspberry Pi have a great and powerful idea behind because it allows us to create whatever we want with it. The only limit is our creativity. When we purchase an Raspberry Pi a part of the money goes to the Foundation which allows children in the world to learn computer sciences and that’s wonderful.

\paragraph{Antoine}

\paragraph{}The Raspberry Pi Foundation had a wonderful idea with combine the charity with the ingenuity. Both of theses words are regroup into the Raspberry Pi who help children in developing countries using the money raised with the price of this device and allows youth to familiarise with technology. This credit card-sized single-board is for me a must for every person wanting to get familiar with technology with an unbeatable value for money.
